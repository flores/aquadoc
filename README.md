A very small and (hopefully) growing collection of documents for planted aquarium nerds.  
Many of these pages will also serve as help documents for the calculators at [petalphile.com][]

This is released under the Whiskey License, which is just like the [Beerware License][], only I prefer whiskey.  
Basically, I hope you find this useful, and you're also free to do whatever you want with it.

This was also an initial commit for the [PyLadies][] Hackathon event on July 18th, as well as an excuse to try [Flask][].
